TurtleMode

If you use TransmissionBT and your router's QoS sucks, this could help.

The purpose of this program is to handle the throttling of the Transmission BT clients on your network.

Rather than relying on a timed schedule, this script will attempt to detect priority devices and throttle BT traffic while they are in use.
